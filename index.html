						<p>By Brian Solomon (<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2016/05/04/how-tableau-built-a-3-billion-data-empire-on-top-of-beautiful-charts/#51071bbb46bb">http://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2016/05/04/how-tableau-built-a-3-billion-data-empire-on-top-of-beautiful-charts/#51071bbb46bb</a>). This story appears in the May 31, 2016 issue of Forbes. Tooltip comments in highlighted text by Jaime Montoya.</p>
						<p>The MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas is a 16,800-seat venue that frequently hosts Ultimate Fighting bouts, rock stars and pop idols. On a Tuesday morning last October the arena was thrumming yet again, except this time the star was a young man in a T-shirt and jeans with a giant number-filled spreadsheet projected behind him. The developer from Tableau Software merely had to show off a new feature that automatically combines two separate data sources into one row and thousands of spectators erupted in applause.</p>
						<p>This kind of over-the-top geek-out is now fairly normal stuff for Tableau cofounder and chief scientist Pat Hanrahan, who reflected on his employee’s performance a few hours later: “There are so many people here now using data–and enjoying it. If I were to say that on day one, you would have laughed. No one believed us that data was cool.”</p>
						<p>Most people still don’t, but companies sure do. The data crunch has replaced the gut check as the key source for decision making, and few products have done more to make that possible than Tableau. The 13-year-old Seattle firm sells <span class="highlight" title="I am not sure if Tableau and Excel should be evaluated in the same category of software as competing products. Microsoft's business intelligence and visualization tools include SQL Server and Power BI. I found Power BI intuitive and easy to use. Once a data cube is created, both Tableau and Power BI offer powerful and intuitive visualization options. I should try the IBM, SAP and Oracle business intelligence and visualization software to understand if they are more difficult to use than Tableau.">software that’s more powerful than Microsoft’s cumbersome old standby Excel and easier to use than any business-intelligence product from IBM, SAP or Oracle.</span> Input your sales, customers, widgets and more and Tableau will quickly spit out beautiful, interactive charts showing trends in time, geography and nearly anything else you desire.</p>
						<p>Selling what Gartner calls the “gold standard” in business intelligence and analytics platforms in the nascent big-data era has proven a fantastic business. Founders Hanrahan, Chris Stolte and Christian Chabot bootstrapped Tableau with meager funding out of Stanford University, taking it all the way to a $254 million public offering in May 2013. Sales grew at an average annual pace of 82% over the last seven years, from $18 million in 2009 to $654 million last year, and Tableau now serves 39,000 customers, including Wells Fargo, Dow Chemical, SpaceX and the Texas Rangers.</p>
						<p>Eventually every high-altitude flight gets bumpy, and Tableau hit its air pocket in February. Fourth-quarter license revenue (the key indicator of new business) grew 31% year over year, great for most companies but a serious slowdown for this rocket ship. The year-end results also showed that in 2015, after five consecutive years of profits, Tableau lost $84 million. Investors, suddenly wary of bubbly tech stocks, sold en masse, sending shares tumbling nearly 50% and erasing $3 billion in value overnight.</p>
						<p>With shares now trading at a near record-low, the three founders have to put Tableau back on track. The academic genius is Hanrahan, a 60-year-old eccentric but brilliant Stanford computer graphics professor who was previously the chief architect for Pixar’s breakthrough RenderMan animation software. Stolte, 43, who was Hanrahan’s Ph.D. student, is the stoic product builder and Tableau’s chief development officer. The ebullient business guy: Chabot, 44, a Stanford M.B.A. who has been CEO from the beginning.</p>
						<p>Hanrahan and Stolte built Tableau on their innovative programming language VizQL, which helps nontechnical people translate large data sets into stunning visuals with a simple drag-and-drop interface. Advanced users can go further, customizing the perfect bar chart, heat map or geographical overlay. Chabot spent the first couple of years driving around Silicon Valley with a software demo in the trunk of his beat-up Geo Prizm, having doors slammed in his perpetually grinning face. <span class="highlight" title="Persistance until venture capital funding was secured and the product took off.">“We always joked that if Tableau didn’t work out, Christian could be an evangelical preacher,”</span> says Forest Baskett, the venture capitalist at NEA who gave the startup its first $5 million.</p>
						<p>Back then nobody wanted what Chabot was selling. “In this arena the dominant religion was that IT departments should control all the data and serve up reports for those silly business users,” he says. So Tableau did something heretical for the time–bypassing IT departments altogether and selling directly to marketing and sales departments, paving the way for later software firms such as Dropbox, Box and Slack Technologies. Tableau’s user-friendliness made it attractive to marketers and analysts fed up with the lackluster reports provided to them. They wanted to manipulate their data and futz with the fonts and colors. IT may not care how pretty a scatterplot looks, but everyone else does. “Tableau is like a painting palette,” says power user Aaron Black, director of informatics at Inova Health System. “It almost makes you feel like you’re an artist instead of an analyst.”</p>
						<p>What started with few free trial downloads inside a company would often spread to dozens of paid accounts until, eventually, whole organizations started coming around. Last year Tableau closed more than 1,000 transactions larger than $100,000.</p>
						<p>As the company grew, Chabot started looking outside the U.S. for fresh growth. In August 2014 he took an unusual step for a CEO, moving his family to London for a year. Initially, Stolte wasn’t thrilled about losing his teammate at Tableau’s Seattle headquarters. “There was a moment of shock and personal worry, but the message it sent was critical,” he says. Today Tableau has deals in 150 countries, and 25% of revenue comes from abroad.</p>
						<p>Tableau’s big fourth-quarter loss, including a sizable miss on the 2016 sales forecast, revealed just how overstretched the company was from all that growth. Kelly Wright, Tableau’s first salesperson other than Chabot, announced her retirement in January, and the company declared a new strategy that prioritized efficiency over head count. Wall Street hopes Tableau can turn those trends around in its first quarter earnings report on Thursday.</p>
						<p>Meanwhile, the $17 billion-a-year business-intelligence market is catching up to Tableau on features and undercutting it on price. <span class="highlight" title="Power BI is powerful and it is developed by a titan in software: Microsoft. No doubt Tableau has a tough competition in a very hot field.">Microsoft in particular is putting up a tough fight</span>, aggressively discounting its Power BI software. To compete, Tableau has to convince people it is an indispensable data platform and not just a tool for building pretty charts. “That’s what they said about Business Objects,” says Wedbush Securities analyst Steve Koenig, referring to the company SAP bought for $6.8 billion in 2007.</p>
						<p>A buyout at that price might not be a bad outcome for Tableau, currently trading at $3.8 billion in market cap. <span class="highlight" title="Microsoft recently bought LinkedIn. Anything can happen in the software industry.">Many wonder how long Tableau will stay independent.</span> Qlik Technologies, one of its main competitors, is already exploring a sale, and Tableau’s new, cheaper valuation makes it an attractive target for the likes of IBM, SAP or <span class="highlight" title="Salesforce.com tried to buy LinkedIn, but it was eventually acquired by Microsoft. It would not be surprising if Salesforce.com buys companies as a business strategy in the near future.">Salesforce.com</span>. JMP Securities analyst Greg McDowell says Tableau would be “a prized asset” for those potential strategic acquirers.</p>
						<p>Tableau’s founders seriously considered selling the company for about $250 million back in 2010. Instead, they stuck it out and raised more than that sum in their IPO three years later. Smart move, and with data’s increasing importance in the workplace, Tableau still has a big role to play in the ongoing business-intelligence upheaval. <span class="highlight" title="Ambitious, realistic, and humble.">“We have built a successful prototype, but I don’t believe we’ve done more than that,” Chabot says. “Globally impactful software companies are 10 to 20 times bigger than we are today–and we want to get there.”</span></p>
						<p>Final thought: "If you torture the data long enough, it will confess." -Ronald H. Coase</p>

						<p>JULY 1, 2016</p>
						<p>OMAHA — The water was still wet, and the wall still got closer with each loping stroke, but for Katie Ledecky, everything else about Friday night’s swim at the U.S. Olympic swimming trials seemed foreign. She was in an outside lane, Lane 1, instead of her customary spot in the middle of the pool, in a race, the final of the 100-meter freestyle, she had never swum in a major meet.</p>
						<p>And when Ledecky, the 19-year-old freestyle phenom from Bethesda, finished seventh and met the media afterward, she was confronted with a question — fair or not — that she never gets: Was this a failure? Her answer was somehow both gracious and honest, without being defensive.</p>
						<p>“No, I didn’t fall flat on my face,” she said. “I have no regrets swimming that. Move on, learn some things. Four years ago I never would’ve thought I’d swim the 100 free final at Olympic trials, so I’m happy with it.” Pointing to the fact she trains regularly with world-class men, she added: <span class="highlight" title="Bruce Gemmell, who began coaching Ledecky in 2012, &quot;long ago abandoned hope of finding female swimmers who could push Ledecky in practice, so she trains at home almost exclusively with men. That arrangement may be the closest thing to a 'secret' behind her success. Great athletes often rise to the level of their competition, and Ledecky’s daily competition features some of the best male distance swimmers in the country.&quot; (https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/how-katie-ledecky-became-better-at-swimming-than-anyone-is-at-anything/2016/06/23/01933534-2f31-11e6-9b37-42985f6a265c_story.html)">“I’m used to failure. I fail every day in practice.”</span></p>
						<p>Failure is not a word often used around the most dominant swimmer in the world, who owns three world records and will head to the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics as the favorite in the 200, 400 and 800 freestyles and the anchor of the 4x200 free relay. Was Friday night a disappointment, though? Certainly. Ledecky had been targeting this race for the better part of a year, hoping her move down in distance and up in speed could garner her a spot on the U.S. 4x100 freestyle relay team at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics — a chance at a fifth event and a fifth medal.</p>
						<p>To lock down a relay spot, she would have needed to finish in the top four Friday night. Two additional spots are available at the coaching staff’s discretion, but they almost always go to the fifth- and sixth-place finishers. Ledecky, though, finished just outside the top six, with a time of 53.99 seconds. She swam the fastest closing 50 meters (27.47) of anyone in the eight-woman field, but her first lap, after which she turned in eighth, left her too much ground to make up.</p>
						<p>Abbey Weitzeil won the race in 53.28, the seventh-fastest time in the world this year, followed by Simone Manuel in 53.52. They will represent the United States in the individual 100 free and will be joined by third-place finisher Amanda Weir (53.75) and Lia Neal (53.77) on the relay. Ledecky, Manuel and Neal all will be teammates at Stanford next season.</p>
						<p>Allison Schmitt (53.87) and Dana Vollmer (53.92) were fifth and sixth, respectively, theoretically giving them the extra relay spots, with a swim in the preliminary heats of the relay. But because Ledecky and eighth-place finisher Kelsi Worrell already had clinched spots on the U.S. Olympic team in other events, they could always be called on in Rio, as well.</p>
						<p>The decision on the relay spots may go all the way to Rio, to the night before the preliminary heats, but it would be highly unlikely for a seventh-place finisher at the trials to leapfrog a higher finisher — and probably a non-starter if it were anyone but Ledecky in seventh place.</p>
						<p>“If they want us on that relay, they can put us in, and if somebody gets sick, we’ll be there,” Ledecky said. “Obviously, I’d love to [swim on the relay], but that’s always up to the coaches. They’ll make the right decision.”</p>
						<p>Friday, then, was an all-around strange day for Ledecky, a day that found her toggling between two different swimming identities. She showed up at CenturyLink Center in the morning as a distance freestyler — and arguably the greatest in history — then warmed down and went back to her hotel, where she ate, napped and returned in the evening as a sprinter, merely one among a group of Olympic hopefuls. Same stroke, same goal — get your hand to the wall before the others — but a different engine and a different mentality.</p>
						<p>Her 800 free prelim was a remarkable show of sheer power. She motored to a time of 8:10.91, the third fastest in history, without the benefit of kicking for the first half of the race as she tried to save her legs for the 100 free final. She won her heat by more than 18 seconds, led all qualifiers by 11 and took sole ownership of the entire list of the top 10 times in history in the event — bumping out Rebecca Adlington, whose 8:14.10 in 2008 stood as the world record until Ledecky took it down in 2013.</p>
						<p>When Ledecky swims the 800 again in Saturday night’s final, a sold-out crowd is likely to be on high alert for a world record. If she wins, as expected, she will be heading to Rio with the mission of sweeping the 200, 400 and 800 freestyles, something no one has done since Debbie Meyer in 1968. The only reason she won’t win the 1,500, too — as she did at least year’s world championships — is because they don’t contest that distance for women in the Olympics.</p>
						<p>Among those on hand to witness Ledecky’s 800 free Friday morning was four-time Olympic gold medalist Janet Evans, the distance darling of the 1980s and 1990s, whose American records Ledecky has slowly dismantled. Evans once owned world records in the 400, 800 and 1,500 but never won a major international gold in the 200 and was never a factor in the 100.</p>
						<p>“I’ve always though Katie was a middle-distance swimmer who kind of hung on for the 800 and the mile — because she’s clearly just that good,” Evans, 44, said of Ledecky’s range. “But [with] her stroke and technique and strength and power . . . it doesn’t surprise me. She’s shown a lot of the easy speed, so it’s evident she can go down to the 100. It just doesn’t surprise me. But I do think it’s an era where that’s not happening as much.”</p>
						<p>Four years ago at this meet, Ledecky finished third in the final of the 400 free, missing a spot on the 2012 London Games by less than second. It may have been the last time in her career, before Friday night, when she felt a deep sense of disappointment.</p>
						<p>But in 2012, she channeled her disappointment into motivation and went out five days later and won the 800 free to earn a trip to London, where she won the race again for gold. She has not lost a final of a major international race since.</p>
						<p>In other words, chances are the 100-meter freestyle hasn’t seen the last of Ledecky, and the next time she swims it, she probably won’t be asked about failure.</p>

						<h1>In Britain, anxiety about immigration started long before the 'Brexit' vote</h1>

						<p>By Michael Hiltzik (<a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-britain-immigration-0629-snap-story.html">http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-britain-immigration-0629-snap-story.html</a>). Tooltip comments in highlighted text by Jaime Montoya.</p>
						<p>JUNE 29, 2016, 1:40 PM | REPORTING FROM LONDON</p>
						<p>To hear European Union officials talk, the freedom of workers to move wherever they wish within the 28-member union is a fundamental principle—one they won’t alter even though discontent with free immigration was a major issue in Britain’s vote last week to leave the EU.</p>
						<p>But it wasn’t always like that. Just over a decade ago, Britain threw open its doors to immigrants from Poland, the Czech Republic, and six other Central and Eastern European countries newly admitted to the EU—while most other EU members took stringent steps to keep them out.</p>
						<img src="media/alpmehmetquote.png" width="650" height="162" alt="" title="">
						<p>The consequences of those actions are still being felt in Britain today. Poles, who represent the largest group of nonnative workers in the country, have become the target of <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-britain-immigrants-20160627-snap-story.html">anti-immigrant sentiment</a> stirred up by the recent “Brexit” campaign, which culminated in Thursday’s vote.</p>
						<p>The reversal of approaches to the movement of labor is one of the ironies of the immigration debate in Britain and its contentious relationship with its 27 European neighbors. It also hints at how deeply misinformation and misunderstandings infect discussions about immigration here, and how they can be exploited to drive public opinion.</p>
						<p>Britons have been rattled by a sharp rise in net immigration over the last 20 years, particularly from EU countries. In 1997, EU immigrants numbered 18,000, about a third of all net immigration; in 2015, the EU accounted for nearly half of the net immigration total of about 333,000.</p>
						<p><span class="highlight" title="What if the UK wants to give priority to high-skilled immigrants, regardless of their nationality?">Of greater concern to policy-makers is that the EU newcomers tend to crowd out better-skilled immigrants from other countries.</span></p>
						<img src="media/euimmigration.png" width="750" height="683" alt="" title="">
						<p>In the immediate aftermath of the landmark referendum, leaders of the Brexit campaign tried to downplay the role of anti-immigrant sentiment.</p>
						<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/26/i-cannot-stress-too-much-that-britain-is-part-of-europe--and-alw/">Writing in Sunday’s Telegraph</a>, former London Mayor Boris Johnson, the leader of the ruling Conservative Party’s Brexit movement, flatly denied that the “Leave” voters were motivated by “anxieties about immigration.”</p>
						<p>Instead, he argued, the paramount issue was <span class="highlight" title="Shouldn't the UK, as a sovereign nation, have the right to control its immigration laws?">“control”</span>—a more nebulous public discontent with bureaucratic rule-making from EU headquarters in Brussels.</p>
						<p>Yet British Prime Minister David Cameron, an EU supporter who announced plans to resign the day after the vote, said just the opposite Tuesday during his final summit with other EU leaders. Fear of <span class="highlight" title="The scenario of a massive exodus from underdeveloped to developed countries is debated at https://www.quora.com/How-feasible-is-a-World-without-borders:
						<br><br>&quot;How feasible is a World without borders?
						<br><br>How feasible is the idea of the world uniting to form a single Government, or operating under a single but unified authority. Is the transition from map with dense borders to no borders even remotely possible?
						<br><br>Are we capable of readily shedding our borders to work together as one real society? Form a cultural and economical Utopia?&quot;
						<br><br>
						Balaji Viswanathan's answer:
						<br><br>&quot;Switzerland has a population of about 8 million. India has a population of about 1250 million. Almost every Indian loves Switzerland. Now, think of what would happen if Switzerland suddenly throws open to all Indians [and Chinese]. Even if 0.5% of India & China migrate, there won't be a Swiss culture anymore. This is quite a serious issue for developed nations bordering underdeveloped nations [...]&quot;
						">mass immigration</span> was “a driving factor” behind the vote, he acknowledged.</p>
						<img src="media/netmigrationtouk.png" width="750" height="502" alt="" title="">
						<p>An anti-immigrant tone was an inescapable feature of the Leave campaign. At one point, right-wing politician Nigel Farage, one of its leaders, introduced a poster depicting a crowd of Middle Eastern refugees. Even though the refugees aren’t a major issue in Britain, the poster bore the legend: “Breaking Point: The EU has failed us all” and established a certain exploitative tone in the campaign.</p>
						<p>As is often the case, the greatest anti-immigrant sentiment, as represented by the Brexit vote, tended to show up in regions with smaller actual immigrant populations, and vice versa. In the northwest of England, where immigrants account for 2.8% of the population, 58% of voters chose to leave the EU. In London, where more than a third of residents are immigrants, 60% of voters opted to stay. That could partly be a result of the voting power of immigrants-turned-citizens, but immigration advocates say it also reflects locals’ greater familiarity with the work their neighbors do—they are less susceptible to immigrant-bashing.</p>
						<p><span class="highlight" title="If immigrants have not been straining governmet programs, why do many Britons believe the opposite?">EU immigration has been a hot topic in Britain at least since 2004. Many Britons assume that immigrants strain government programs; in fact a higher percentage are employed than are native Britons, and the vast majority claim no public assistance.</span></p>
						<p><span class="highlight" title="If immigrants have not been straining governmet programs, why do many Britons believe the opposite?">A widely cited study by University College London found that EU immigrants have brought <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1114/051114-economic-impact-EU-immigration">a net fiscal benefit</a>—paying as much as much as $26 billion more into public coffers than they consume in services. Moreover, the study asserted, they have endowed the country with “productive human capital that would have cost the UK £6.8bn [$9.5 billion] in spending on education.”</span></p>
						<p><span class="highlight" title="There is no clear correlation between a country's population density and its development trends. Nonetheless, an overpopulated country where the vast majority are low-skilled workers may not offer promising results.">Yet immigration critics maintain that Britain simply doesn’t have room for continued immigration at its current rate, especially of low-income workers.</span></p>
						<p><span class="highlight" title="Uncontrolled overpopulation can increase poverty.">“Immigration must be brought to manageable levels, so we can provide for these people and make sure they integrate with society,”</span> says Alp Mehmet, vice chairman of Migration Watch UK. His organization places a “sustainable level of properly managed immigration” at about 60,000-70,000 a year.</p>
						<p>The Cameron government has set an annual target of 100,000 immigrants—less than a third of the current level—but there doesn't seem to be a clear rationale for picking that figure.</p>
						<p>“There’s no logic to it other than it’s a round number,” says Carlos Vargas-Silva, senior researcher at <a href="http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk">Oxford University’s Migration Observatory</a>.</p>
						<p><span class="highlight" title="Under the EU regulations, the UK can be picky about who they accept from outside the EU, but they must accept anyone from the UE.">What’s more important is that the mandate to accept unlimited EU immigration interferes with efforts to weight total inflows more heavily toward high-skilled workers.</span></p>

						<p>EU nationals, however, cluster in unskilled occupations. Their influx since 2004 has changed the pattern—and the image—of the British immigrant.</p>
						<p>The immigration issue had little political weight here through the mid-1990s, when net immigration was low, and sometimes negative. There was little economic rationale for EU citizens to move to Britain, because the economic disparities between their home countries and Britain were not very great.</p>
						<p>But a change occurred in 2004. The EU admitted eight new members, including Poland, but instituted a tight lid on their citizens’ right of movement for up to seven years. Only Britain, Ireland, and Sweden welcomed the new members. Basing its expectations on previous patterns of EU immigration, the Labor government of Tony Blair complacently assumed EU immigration would remain at historical levels.</p>
						<p>Instead, tens of thousands of workers from Eastern and Central Europe showed up. Poland unseated India, Pakistan and Ireland as the leading national source of immigration, totaling almost 1 million over the next 10 years.</p>
						<p>“To have low-income countries join the EU was unprecedented,” says Vargas-Silva. <span class="highlight" title="Unsurprisingly.">With per capita incomes in Britain roughly twice that of Poland, and workers’ purchasing power three times as high, the prospect of working in Britain had become irresistible.</span></p>
						<p><span class="highlight" title="Under the EU regulations, the UK can be picky about who they accept from outside the EU, but they must accept anyone from the UE.">British government officials say they don’t want to cut off all EU immigration, merely apply the same standards faced by applicants from elsewhere.</span></p>
						<p><span class="highlight" title="Under the EU regulations, the UK can be picky about who they accept from outside the EU, but they must accept anyone from the UE.">Those applicants must qualify for visas through a point system awarding credit for various desirable qualities, such as education, English aptitude, and work experience. Non-EU citizens also face caps on the number of workers admitted even for high-skilled work. Incoming workers must have a job offer in hand, and rules have been tightened on students and family members with non-EU citizenship—even spouses of British citizens aren’t automatically admitted.</span></p>
						<p><span class="highlight" title="If immigration to the UK for work purposes was a race, it would be fair to say that EU citizens are receiving an unfair advantage.">There’s little doubt that such rules would shut down the flow of EU citizens into Britain. As much as 90% of the existing EU immigrant workforce, Vargas-Silva estimates, would fail to qualify if the rules were applied to them.</span></p>

						<p>A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or web site that fits on a single web page with the goal of providing a more fluid user experience similar to a desktop application. In a SPA, either all necessary code – HTML, JavaScript, and CSS – is retrieved with a single page load, or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions. The page does not reload at any point in the process, nor does control transfer to another page, although the location hash can be used to provide the perception and navigability of separate logical pages in the application, as can the HTML5 pushState() API. Interaction with the single page application often involves dynamic communication with the web server behind the scenes.</p>-->
